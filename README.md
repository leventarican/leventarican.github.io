## Build and serve

```bash
# start local serving
./zola serve
# server is available at http://127.0.0.1:1111

# build docs/ folder (= create static files)
./zola build --output-dir docs --force
```

## Get zola
Download zola from https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases (i.e. for Linux `*.tar.gz`). Extract with `tar xfv *.tar.gz`.

```bash
