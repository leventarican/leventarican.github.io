# About 
This document gives an overview about SSE. What is it. When to use. The Terminology.

# Introduction
As the abbr. suggest the contept behind SSE is that the server is sending data _asynchronously_ to client.
The connection client-server is done _once_.

This approach differs from the well-known concept of client-server communication.
Where client does a request to a server and the server responses to client.
The difference is that the initiation is done by the client.

Whereas in the SSE concept the server initiates.
