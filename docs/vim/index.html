    vim and nvim
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-12-19</strong></p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>This document gives an overview about nvim. 
The concepts here are also applicable for vim and partially for vi.
But I will mostly focus on nvim. But to keep it short and generall i will use vim. </p>
<p>Originally there was <code>vi</code>, then <code>vim</code> came and finally neovim aka. <code>nvim</code> arrivied.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>Why am I using in some cases vim?</p>
<p>Basically vim is installed by default on linux and mac - it's <strong>everywhere</strong>. So whenever we login to a machine we can start wird text editing.
My other main reason is that in vim I am more <strong>focused</strong>. Especially that I not need a mouse and completely navigate via keyboard. This is the so called vim motion.
And it's <strong>fast</strong>.</p>
<p>For me an alternative editor to vim (but with UI) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>scite (scintilla)</li>
<li>vscode</li>
<li>geany (based on scintilla)</li>
<li>sublime</li>
</ul>
<p>I used that editor's in the past to edit files from various formats. But none of them are fast as vim.</p>
<p>Another thing is that i usually done a lot of things in <code>console</code>. The reason for that are various. </p>
<ul>
<li>The console is deterministic. </li>
<li>Text is universal. </li>
<li>Easy to automate.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more thing is when editing text in any kind of program we navigate using usually with arrow keys. Pressing it several times.
Instead of hitting arrow keys several times we can invest time in vim shortcut's like <code>dw</code> - delete word right from cursor.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Now as mentioned vim is by default installed on your machine or server.
By hitting <code>vim</code> in console you are ready to code. </p>
<p>Vim has by default vim has a file explorer <code>netrw</code>. </p>
<p>When enriching with plugins it can even more.</p>
<p>You can even attach a language server (protocoll) so that code completion is possible. But in such cases i use IDE's like <code>intellij</code> or <code>eclipse</code>.</p>
<p>To keep the dependency less I used minimum plugins. The plugins should work for both <code>vim</code> and <code>nvim</code>.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>The default vim is enough for editing text but with few plugins and colorscheme vim is more enriched.</p>
<p>Here I give the main plugins I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>telescope</code>   - with this plugin you can filter files in your current working directy. So we can navigate fast in our current working directory.</li>
<li><code>lualine</code>     - give you a good overview in status line. Like which vim mode or git branch</li>
<li><code>nvim-treesitter</code> - parses your text as tree and gives you syntax highlighting.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install the plugins I use nvim <code>packer</code>.</p>
<p>A short note here. <code>vim</code> works with <code>.vim</code> files <code>nvim</code> can also understand <code>.lua</code> files.
So when configuring <code>nvim</code> i prefer <code>.lua</code>.</p>
